_ July 18 2025 (Friday) - Self code

_ Wanted to challenge myself on this assignment. Choose not to use the built-in function or methods (append, extend, more), but stick to the general language function.

_ Spent about 1 hour

_ Learnt that list + list is valid. Meaning concatenation can only be performed with elements of the same type.

_ Did the exercise on Code Academy [Python Code Challenges: Lists] [Learn Python3 {course}]
