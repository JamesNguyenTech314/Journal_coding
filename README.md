### 📅 **July 18, 2025 (Friday) — Self Code Journal**

---

#### 🧠 **Challenge Chosen**
> _Opted not to use built-in methods like `append`, `extend`, etc._  
> Wanted to push logic-based problem-solving by handling list operations manually.

---

#### ⏱️ **Time Spent**
> 🕒 Approximately **1 hour**

---

#### 📌 **Key Learnings**
- ✅ You can use `list + list` to concatenate lists.
- ⚠️ Concatenation only works between **elements of the same type** (e.g., `list + list`, not `list + int`).
- 🧩 Reinforced core understanding of list operations without relying on built-ins.

#### ✍️ Notes to Self
> Keep challenging myself by building deeper logic without shortcuts.  
> Write clean, readable code and document each approach with clarity.
