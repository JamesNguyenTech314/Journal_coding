## ðŸ“š Author Last Name Extractor â€” Python String Practice

During my Python practice, I worked on extracting last names from a string of full author names. This was a great exercise to strengthen my skills with:

- String splitting (`.split()`)
- Looping through lists
- Using negative indexing (`[-1]`)
- Comparing code solutions for clarity and efficiency

### This is my code. I was surprised that CodeAcademy did not allow this one even though it gave the same result as CodeAcademy's solution. Had to run through ChatGpt to make sure i'm not the only one to get the code to work with said requirements.

### This is CodeAcademy's code. I liked that it is super short in comparison to mine. Defintely gonna learn this one.

Overall I learnt to make a last name list from this exercise.
